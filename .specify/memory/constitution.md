# Humanoid Robotics Research Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must adhere to established style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Style Guide for C++). Code should be clear, concise, and well-documented. Regular code reviews are mandatory to ensure quality and knowledge sharing.

### II. Testing Standards
A comprehensive test suite is required for all code. This includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete features. Test coverage must meet or exceed 80% for all new code.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing components must adhere to a consistent design language and user experience. This includes consistent terminology, layout, and interaction patterns. A central style guide and component library will be maintained.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All code must meet defined performance requirements. This includes latency, throughput, and resource usage. Performance testing will be a part of the standard development process.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices. Any amendments require a formal proposal, review, and approval process. All pull requests must be reviewed for compliance with the principles outlined in this document.
